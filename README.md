App that allows user to enter address and get response with temps. Used open-weather-ruby-client gem https://github.com/dblock/open-weather-ruby-client. User will need to get an open weather api token and place in .ENV. Run rails server, go to localhost3000 and put in adress and click submit. Added caching for 30 minutes but didn't have time to test as well as I wanted.
